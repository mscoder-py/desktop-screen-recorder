4. ### Output:

- File saved in the current directory, e.g., record_20251007_143022.mp4.
- Success message: ‚úÖ Saved as record_20251007_143022.mp4.



#### Pro Tip: For longer recordings, ensure your disk has space‚Äîhigh bitrate means ~1GB per 5-10 minutes.

# üõ† Customization
### Edit recorder.py for tweaks:

- FFmpeg Path: Update ffmpeg_path for your setup (e.g., custom install dir).
- Video Settings: Change -framerate, -crf, -preset, or -b:v in the command list.
- Audio Filters: Modify the filter_complex string (e.g., adjust volume=6.0 or add more effects).
- Output Format: Swap .mp4 for .mkv or add -t 300 for time-limited recordings.
- Banner/Colors: Tweak main_banner() or colorize() for your style.

### To bundle as EXE (portable app):
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "ffmpeg.exe;." recorder.py
```
#### (Include FFmpeg.exe in the bundle for no-install runs.)
